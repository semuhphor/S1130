## IBM 1130 Emulator in C#

This is an IBM 1130 emulator modified to build and run with .NET Core, compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows. 

The emulator provides a complete IBM 1130 system simulation including:
- CPU instruction set implementation
- Device emulation (2501 card reader, 2310 disk drive)
- Memory management
- Interrupt handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) or later
- A C# compatible IDE or text editor

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/semuhphor/S1130.git
   cd S1130
   ```

2. Restore dependencies and build:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

### Running Tests

Execute the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
dotnet test
```

The project includes 335+ unit tests covering CPU instructions, device operations, and system integration scenarios. Test execution typically completes in under 2 seconds.

#### Test Output
- **Passed/Failed/Skipped counts**: Summary of test execution results
- **Performance metrics**: The test suite includes performance benchmarks (e.g., "1M Instructions in 1000ms")
- **Coverage**: Tests validate instruction execution, device behavior, and edge cases

## Project Status

- âœ… **CPU Core**: Fully functional instruction set implementation
- âœ… **2501 Card Reader**: Complete with test coverage
- ðŸš§ **2310 Disk Drive**: Partial implementation in progress
- ðŸ“‹ **PowerShell Integration**: Legacy script available but untested

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on:
- Code style and conventions  
- Testing requirements
- Pull request process

### Development Guidelines

- **Test-Driven Development**: All new code should include comprehensive unit tests
- **Documentation**: Public APIs should include XML documentation comments
- **Error Handling**: Exception-prone areas require robust error handling and clear failure modes
